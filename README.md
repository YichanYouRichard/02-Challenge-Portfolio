# 01 Portfolio

## Challenge Type

### Your Task
My Challenge is an on-the-job ticket&mdash;meaning that you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. 

## User Story

I created the portoflio website to showcase my skills and talents to the employers that are looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
